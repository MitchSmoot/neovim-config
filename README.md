# neovim-config

This is my config for Neovim, so that it can be shared across all of my computers.

This was originally created from kickstart-nvim, but is evolving into my own.
Currently cleaning up the file structure and adding more plugins.

## Featured Plugins

- Oil.nvim
- Harpoon
- Vim-Be-Good
